                    <strong>Note</strong>
                    <p>The discography of Nirvana, an Aberdeen, Washington-based American rock band, consists of three studio albums, twenty-one singles, five live albums, two extended plays, four compilation albums, and two box sets.
                        Nirvana was formed in 1987 by vocalist and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic, with the position of drummer being filled by various musicians. The band released its debut album, Bleach,
                         in 1989 on independent label Sub Pop. After being joined by final drummer Dave Grohl and signing to Geffen Records subsidiary DGC Records, the band released its second studio album, Nevermind,
                          which became one of the best selling alternative albums of the 1990s and popularized the Seattle grunge movement and alternative music. The band's third album, In Utero, was also a commercial and
                           critical success, though it did not match the sales precedent set by Nevermindâ€”as the members of the band expected.[4] Nirvana disbanded in 1994 after the death of Cobain; since then several posthumous 
                           releases have been issued from the band, which once resulted in a legal conflict between Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, and the surviving members of the band over the release of the song "You Know You're Right". 
                           In 2006, Love sold a significant share of the rights to Cobain's song catalog to Primary Wave Music Publishing. Since its debut, the band has sold 27.6 million albums in the United States alone, and over 75 million records worldwide.</p>
